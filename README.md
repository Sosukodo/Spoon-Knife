### Learning Git

This repository is meant to help me learn about *forking* and *updating* repositories on GitHub.

#### Git setup for repository

`git config --global user.name "<USER"`
`git config --global user.email <EMAIL>`

#### After working on code
`git add .`

`git push origin master:master`

`git commit -m "Changed README.md"`

#### Sync with remote repository
`git pull`

It will only sync if the changes on the remote were committed (obviously).
